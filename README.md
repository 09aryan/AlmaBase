## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the app on your local machine:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd alumni-app

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

### Set up your Node.js server

1. Clone the server repository (if separate) or create your own Node.js server.
2. Configure the server to handle authentication, user profiles, and other required functionalities.

### Update the app to communicate with your Node.js server

1. Modify API endpoints in the app to match your server routes.

   - **Update authentication screen (`lib/screens/authentication_screen.dart`):**

     ```dart
     // lib/screens/authentication_screen.dart

     // Add your authentication screen implementation here
     // Update API endpoints for authentication
     // ...
     ```

   - **Update profile screen (`lib/screens/profile_screen.dart`):**

     ```dart
     // lib/screens/profile_screen.dart

     // Add your profile screen implementation here
     // Update API endpoints for user profile
     // ...
     ```

   - **Update news feed screen (`lib/screens/news_feed_screen.dart`):**

     ```dart
     // lib/screens/news_feed_screen.dart

     // Add your news feed screen implementation here
     // Update API endpoints for fetching news feed
     // ...
     ```

   - **Update directory screen (`lib/screens/directory_screen.dart`):**

     ```dart
     // lib/screens/directory_screen.dart

     // Add your directory screen implementation here
     // Update API endpoints for searching alumni
     // ...
     ```

   - **Update messaging screen (`lib/screens/messaging_screen.dart`):**

     ```dart
     // lib/screens/messaging_screen.dart

     // Add your messaging screen implementation here
     // Update API endpoints for private messaging
     // ...
     ```

   - **Update notification screen (`lib/screens/notification_screen.dart`):**

     ```dart
     // lib/screens/notification_screen.dart

     // Add your notification screen implementation here
     // Update API endpoints for handling notifications
     // ...
     ```

2. Update authentication and data fetching logic accordingly.

   - Review and modify the logic in each screen file to handle authentication and data fetching based on the updated API endpoints.

3. Run the app:

   ```bash
   flutter run
